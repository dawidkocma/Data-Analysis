## 📝 Project Overview
This project explores salary trends across various undergraduate majors to determine which degrees offer the best financial return. By analyzing starting salaries, mid-career earnings, and salary spreads, we identify the most promising career paths.

## 🔥 Features
✅ Web scraping salary data from PayScale 📡  
✅ Data cleaning and preprocessing 🧹  
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insights 📈  
✅ Salary trends visualization 🎨  
✅ Identifying top-paying degrees 💰  

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes:
- **Undergraduate Major** 🎓  
- **Starting Median Salary** 💵  
- **Mid-Career Median Salary** 📊  
- **Mid-Career 10th Percentile Salary** 🔽  
- **Mid-Career 90th Percentile Salary** 🔼  
- **Group** (categorizing majors by field) 🏷️  

## 🛠 Methods
1️⃣ **Data Collection**: Scrape salary data from PayScale or use publicly available datasets.
